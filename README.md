### SmartHealthcareChatbot

A chatbot that predicts possible diagnoses

## **Project Tasks Overview**

To successfully develop the **AI-powered healthcare chatbot**, the following tasks need to be completed:

1.  **Define Project Scope & Gather Data**

    -   Identify chatbot functionalities and use cases.
    -   Collect and preprocess symptom-disease datasets for model training.

2.  **Implement Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for Disease Prediction**

    -   Define **states (diseases)** and **observations (symptoms)**.
    -   Train the **HMM model** and optimize transition & emission probabilities.
    -   Implement the **Viterbi algorithm** for symptom-based disease inference.

3.  **Develop NLP-Based Symptom Extraction**

    -   Use **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to analyze user input.
    -   Implement **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** to detect symptoms.

4.  **Implement Dynamic Chatbot Response Generation**

    -   Create **template-based responses** for different diagnoses.
    -   (Optional) Integrate **AI-powered responses** using a language model (e.g., GPT-4).

5.  **Build a Graphical User Interface (GUI)**

    -   Develop a user-friendly **Python-based GUI** for interaction.
    -   Implement input fields, chatbot responses, and an intuitive design.

6.  **Integrate All Components into a Functional System**

    -   Connect **HMM, NLP, and chatbot responses** into a single application.
    -   Ensure smooth communication between **backend logic and GUI**.

7.  **Testing & Optimization**

    -   Test chatbot accuracy in **symptom recognition and disease prediction**.
    -   Debug errors and refine response generation.

8.  **Deploy & Finalize the Application**

    -   Package the application for deployment.
    -   Create documentation for usage and future improvements.
